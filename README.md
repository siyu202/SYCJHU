# Decision Analytics Foundamentals Project: Investigation on Baltimore societal questions using data analytics

#Baltimore societal questions

These are the questions that I want to investigate

1. Discover the trend of crime rate for Baltimore in the past 10 years. Is there a relationship between the crime type, numbers of cases, region and time? 

2. Discover the average annual salary of different groups based on different industry. Are there relationships between the employees’ educational level, race, gender, age and the salary level? 

3. Discover the use of electric cars in the past 5 years. How many people have switch to new energy vehicles and what are the characteristics of the reference group? (e.g. The age, region, income level…) Then, try to use historical data to extrapolate: will new-energy vehicles replace traditional cars in the future? By how much percent?
