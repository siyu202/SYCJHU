# Decision Analytics Foundamentals Project: Discovering the driving factors behind the high crime rate in Baltimore

#Baltimore societal questions

These are the questions that I want to investigate

1. Discover the trend of crime rate for Baltimore in the past 10 years. Is there a relationship between the crime type, numbers of cases, region and time? 

2. Discover the average annual salary of different groups based on different industry. Are there relationships between the employees’ educational level, race, gender, age and the salary level? 

3. Discover the use of electric cars in the past 5 years. How many people have switch to new energy vehicles and what are the characteristics of the reference group? (e.g. The age, region, income level…) Then, try to use historical data to extrapolate: will new-energy vehicles replace traditional cars in the future? By how much percent?

This graph shows the crime rate with respect to geographic region. 
Several info we can get: 1) Around 90% of the areas in baltimore have crime rate higher than the US average. 2) The regions with high crime rate tend to aggregate in space.

The multivariable regression can give us an idea of the driving factors for the numbers of property crime. For the equation, we can see the influencing factors from the coeffient in front of each variables；and the positive and negative sign will show the trend. Moreover, we can try to predict the future property crime number using the refined regression equation, if the value of the independent variables were given.
